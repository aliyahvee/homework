  <h1> Respecting Your Elders: Bronx artists pay homage to elders in new art exhibit</h1>

<p>By Aliyah Veal</p>

<div>
<p>The idea of painting words on the arms, legs, and feet of elders came from a conversation between Evan Bishop and Katori Walker's grandmother, Thelma Jenkins.</p>

<p>“Evan and I were just running our mouth. He just said ‘Nana, what word would you like?’ I said focus and he thought about it and then he asked me why.

The next thing I know this whole thing just blew up,” Jenkins said, adding, “I had no idea it was going to become what it was.” </p>

<p>One conversation started 140 more to create “100 Words of Wisdom”, an art exhibit paying homage to senior citizens and their advice to millennials.

Bishop and Walker have been practicing this art style for four years, a technique that Bishop said is about serving the wants of people. “We have branded

our style to be impactful symbols or words that people choose for themselves. That transitioned in this project to do the same,” Bishop said. </p>

<p>Elders choose their word, the colors they wanted to use, and the body part they wanted the word painted on. Bishop then painted the word of choice in graffiti style lettering,

while Walker documented the finished product through photos.</p>

<p>“Graffiti was a juxtaposition. It’s young and hip. Elders are not as young. To bring those two words together, just seems unique,” he said.</p>

<p>In a society dominated by technology, Evan Bishop and Katori Walker crafted an exhibition that reintroduces interpersonal conversations.

Millennials connected to their work without the use of tweets or snapchat filters.</p>

<p>“We had an artist’s talk with students at Sarah Lawrence. They came in and we told them to pick their favorite pictures and tell us why.

They had the opportunity to explain the different pictures that moved them,” Walker said. Walker added that she and Bishop explained their

mission and purpose to the students and gave background information about the participants.</p>

<p>“That really made a deeper connection with them,” she said.</p>

<p>“Focus.”</p>
<p>Amidst her winged eyeliner and plum red lipstick with matching nails, the word focus on Thelma Jenkins’ brown cheek is an added accessory.

The five letter world is painted in gold letters with accents of white, blue, and black outlining it. </p> 

<p>“You have a goal, focus on your goals. Things are different now. If you want to do something, keep your eyes on the prize.

Don’t go up, left, right, down, all over the place. You’ll get there,” Jenkins said.</p>

<p>Thelma Jenkins has lived for 96 years and confidently admitted that she had no regrets. “Everything I did or didn’t do because whatever,

whether it’s good or bad, it’s a learning experience. That’s what you got erasers on the pencils for,” she said.</p>

<p>She admitted to making her fair share of mistakes, but that the beauty was in not making the same mistake again.

“Don’t take them, learn from them,” she said. </p>

<p>“Compassion.”</p>
<p>Juanita Frye, 68, got “compassion” painted in pink and baby blue capital letters to create a cotton candy infusion that started

from Frye’s hand to the inside of her elbow. She explained that the arm is an extension of the body and the hand and

one is giving with and embracing with the arm. </p>

<p>“I chose the word because I really feel that there is a need for us to understand what sympathy is, about what caring is, and

placing ourselves in someone else’s position. It’s very important as we mature and grow to understand and place ourselves in the

position of others so that we can open our hearts,” she said.</p>

<p>Frye became more aware of being compassionate by becoming a caregiver to her 99-year-old mother and a friend who suffers from mental illness.

She said she placed herself in their position, which helped her understand where they were in their lives.</p>

<p>“If I can give a little of me to them, that helps me to open up and to understand and to share.” </p>

<p>As for the perks of getting older, Frye said, “It’s a lot easier to say no because you know what you like and what you don’t like.

You’ve learned how to set some boundaries. There is a learning with the seasonings.”</p>

<p>For Evan Bishop and Katori Walker, this exhibition wasn’t just about giving senior citizens their just due. It was also about legacy.

"It goes back to the main ingredients: Katori's 96-year-old grandmother and our two grandchildren and us realizing and discussing

how important it is for our grandchildren to get as much from everyone, not just us," Bishop said. </p>
